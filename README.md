This is my submission for HW7 in CMSC508 for the 2023 Fall Semester. Contained inside is a database. The database contains information about people, their skills, their roles, and the relationships betwixt them. This is for an imaginary company, in order for them to determine which employees contain which skills and where skill gaps are.
